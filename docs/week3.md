# Week 3: Volcanoes

![Week 3 Cover image](./assets/images/volc.png)

During this week, we will look at how plate tectonics results in volcanoes and igneous systems, the rocks which form from them, and some of the impacts these have on society.

This section will contain lecture slides, the laboratory worksheet, and the assigned reading for the week.

## Reading

I would like you to read Chapters 4-5 of Lutgens and Tarbuck 2015 *Essentials of Geology* (available as an e-book, top of the reading list - see the link in the sidebar). Chapter 4 is the chapter on Igneous rocks and Intrusive activity, which will help you understand the first part of the lecture, and the intrusive rocks you'll see in the lab; Chapter 5 is the chapter on Volcanoes and Volcanic Hazards, which will help you understand the second half of the lecture, and the volcanic rocks you'll see in the lab. I highly recommend reading these before the labs, which will be much easier if you do.

An alternative is [Chapter Four](https://opengeology.org/textbook/4-igneous-processes-and-volcanoes/) of Johnson, C., Affolter, M.D., Inkenbrandt, P., and Mosher, C. (2017) An Introduction to Geology. USA: Salt Lake Community College. This is the chapter on Igneous Processes and Volcanoes.
