# Week 9: Laurentia, Avalonia, and the Iapetus Ocean

![Week 9 Cover image](./assets/images/mph.png)

Now that we've covered all the main types of rocks, looking at how they form and some of the ways they've influenced society, it's time to think about how all those types of rock come together to form particular places. And what better place to consider than our own island of Ireland. During this week, we will look at how Ireland used to be part of not one but two different continents, called Laurentia and Avalonia, separated by an ocean called Iapetus. We'll cover what happened to those continents and that ocean, and how those events have had lasting impacts that still influence Irish society today.

This section will contain lecture slides, the laboratory worksheet, and the assigned reading for the week.

## Reading

I would like you to read Chapter 10 of Lutgens and Tarbuck 2015 *Essentials of Geology* (available as an e-book, top of the reading list - see the link in the sidebar). This is the chapter on the origin and evolution of the ocean floor, and it will help you to understand what was happening during the events described in the lecture.

I would also like you to read Chapters 2-4 of [Understanding Earth Processes Rocks and the Geology of Ireland](https://gsi.ie/documents/UnderstandingEarth_bookmarked.pdf) by Sleeman et al. These cover the Precambrian to Silurian, and will more directly expand on what we cover in the lecture.

I would also like you to read a short paper on how mining influenced society. The virtual field trip during reading week looked at Parys mine in Wales - at the same time, we had copper mining in Waterford.
