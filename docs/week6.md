## Reading

I would like you to read [Chapter 16](https://opengeology.org/textbook/16-energy-and-mineral-resources/) of Johnson, C., Affolter, M.D., Inkenbrandt, P., and Mosher, C. (2017) An Introduction to Geology. USA: Salt Lake Community College. This is the chapter on Energy and Mineral Resources, and will help you to understand Parys mine. 

There is much more information about Parys Mine online: I suggest the website of the Anglesey Underground group, which has a lot of information about the history, industry, and people as well as the mine itself: [https://www.parysmountain.co.uk/](https://www.parysmountain.co.uk/)
